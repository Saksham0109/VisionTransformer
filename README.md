# VisionTransformer
This repository contains all code i wrote or used while reading up about Vision Transformers using the research paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

## AnImageIsWorth16x16Words
This jupyter notebook contains the code for the model that i wrote alongside explainations.

## PretrainedViT
This imports a pretrained(on ImageNet) ViT model and applies it on a video input giving an output of a video which contains the classification as text.

vid.mp4 and video.mp4 is an example of the input and output video

## PretrainedModel
This is code for a pretrained model which i made changes to in order to give weights alongside the output

## VisualisingAttention

This file uses the PretrainedModel to give the attention layer as an image.This helps us see which part of the image was under focus by the model.
